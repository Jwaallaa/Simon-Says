# Simon-Says
I created a Simon Says game to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The game uses dynamic styling with CSS for visual feedback and JavaScript to handle user interactions, sequence generation, and game logic. This project helped me solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.
